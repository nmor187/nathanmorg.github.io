            <p>
                <img src="./images/notion_system.jpg">
                This is a modified version of a notion template for an IT Ticket System.  
                You can draft tickets, submit, and modify their progress as in progress or done.  This allows
                me to create a ticket when someone I know is experiencing an issue, I can then describe it, and 
                put it through this process.  <br>
                The benefits of this are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to keep records of the support I provide</li>
                    <li>Creation of a "knowledge base" of sorts from the accumulated solutions to issues</li>
                    <li>Keep track of ongoing issues</li>
                    <li>Can reveal recurring problems or patterns that may symbolize larger issues
                (For example: if someone's laptop keeps having hard drive corruption issues or reliability issues, 
                records of support might show that either that laptop or that hard drive needs replacing.)</li>
                </ul>   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ticket Formats & Categories</h1>
            <p>
                <img src="./images/notion_ticket.jpg">
                The formatting and potential labels for each ticket are robust.  Most importantly, 
                tickets can be prioritized so that the most pressing critical issues are resolved first.  
                <br><br>
                There are also various different types of tickets.  You can label them as general questions, 
                hardware issue, hardware request, software issue, software request, and suggestions.
                <br><br>
                Finally, as seen towards the bottom of this image, you can see that the issue description and resolution
                are both tracked.  On some tickets with simple solutions, the resolution will be sample, on others, many different
                solutions can be recorded and dated accordingly.
